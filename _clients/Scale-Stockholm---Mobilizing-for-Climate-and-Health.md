How can residents, associations, and local businesses play an active role in Stockholm’s climate efforts? This is the core question of Scale Stockholm, an EU-funded project where the city, together with various partners, develops local solutions for a greener and healthier future. Digidem Lab is involved in developing methods for citizen participation and democratic engagement in the city’s climate transition.

Stockholm has set ambitious climate goals for 2030, requiring broad collaboration and innovative measures. Scale Stockholm is part of the EU’s NetZeroCities Pilot Cities Programme and is funded through Horizon 2020, aiming to accelerate the transition to climate-neutral cities. At the same time, the project seeks to improve public health by reducing emissions and creating sustainable living environments.

The project focuses on four geographical pilot areas where sustainability initiatives are already underway: the Inner City, Norra Djurgårdsstaden, Järva, and the Stockholm Green Innovation District (Årsta–Sickla). These areas differ in population, urban development, and local conditions, providing unique opportunities to test and adapt different methods.

One of the project’s key tools is local transition arenas, where residents, associations, and businesses collaborate to develop and prioritize concrete climate and health initiatives. These initiatives are tested over a year, evaluated, adjusted, or scaled up to expand successful solutions across the city.

To ensure an inclusive and accessible process, participatory and co-creation methods are used. Digidem Lab contributes expertise in citizen engagement and digital democracy.
