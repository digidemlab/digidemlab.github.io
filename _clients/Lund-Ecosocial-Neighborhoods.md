[Lund municipality ](https://lund.se/ "Lunds municipality")has for several years worked strategically to reduce emissions. This year, the focus is on bringing together research, civil society, municipal operations, and citizens’ own experiences. The aim is to develop approaches, methods, and concrete tools that both reduce the municipality's consumption-based emissions and strengthen participation, as well as increases equal living conditions across neighborhoods.

The project Eco-Social Neighborhoods: Tools for Sustainable Consumption and Inclusive Climate Transition is funded by [Formas](https://formas.se/en/start-page.html "Formas english") and brings together four partners from the public sector, academia, and civil society. Lund municipality leads and coordinates the work. [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/ "lund uni eng") contributes research on the social effects of the climate transition, and is responsible for the project’s scientific evaluation. [The Swedish Environmental Institute](https://www.sei.org/ "SEI") further develops the tool [Consumption Compass](https://www.sei.org/tools/consumption-compass-2-0/ "Consumption compass") to create eco-social consumption profiles that also take socioeconomic conditions into account. Digidem Lab facilitates the [citizen dialogue](https://lund.se/nyheter/aktuellt/klimatdialog-pa-norra-faladen "Klimatdialog"), which forms the core of the project, so that Lund municipality together with residents can identify measures that reduce consumption-based emissions without diminishing quality of life.

The results will contribute to the Lund municipality's work on developing a climate roadmap and neighborhood programs for the different districts, as well as to the goal of halving household consumption-based emissions per resident by 2030.
