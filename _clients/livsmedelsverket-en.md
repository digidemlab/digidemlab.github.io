To provide recommendations to the government on how all of Sweden can eat more sustainably and healthier, the Swedish National Food Agency (SLV) decided to organise a Citizens' Assembly, the first process of its kind in Sweden. Digidem Lab was hired to plan and implement the national citizens' assembly.

A total of 60 participants from all over Sweden were selected through Digidem Lab's customised selection process, based on gender, educational background, age, place of residence and type of municipality.

An initial group of 7,000 people were invited to participate via SMS or letter. These people were then asked to register their interest and answer a few questions about age, gender and education level, among other things. 60 of those who registered their interest were then selected for the citizen panel based on our selection model.

Digidem Lab organised and led a team of facilitators who led discussions in four separate six-hour sessions to analyse the issue under the sub-headings of food supply, advertising and exposure, and opportunity and accessibility, with expert help from seven leading food scientists. Each group then proposed recommendations for the panel as a whole to consider.

The final thirty recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly were submitted to the Swedish National Food Agency on 10 June 2023 and will form the basis of the Agency's response to the Government's assignment S2021/03523 together with the Public Health Agency of Sweden in January 2024.
