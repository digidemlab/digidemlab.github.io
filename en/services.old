## Inclusive participation
We design citizen centered processes based on international experiences and methods, to specifically involve under-represented groups.

## Security and flexibility
We use Consul and Decidim, two of the most advanced digital platforms for citizen participation, with millions of users all over the world.

## Simpler administration of dialogues
By implementing a digital platform for citizen participation, local authorities can administer all their processes from one place.
