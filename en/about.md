We are a worker-owned cooperative that designs and develops methods for political and democratic innovation. We are passionate about participatory democracy and support practices that empower people to influence the decisions that affect their lives.

## Our values
### Participation
We believe in developing democracy to include more aspects of society and developing methods to create greater participation. We believe in co-creation in all aspects of our work, including the development of processes and digital tools for participation.

### Mandate

We want people who are affected by decisions to have a say in making them. We work to ensure that our projects have a clearly defined mandate for participants.

### Transparency
We promote greater transparency in participatory processes. We share our knowledge and experience. Our digital tools are open source to ensure security and auditability.

### Cooperation
We build on the successful experiences and work of others and strive to share our knowledge, code and expertise with others.

### Continuous learning
We are constantly developing our methods and tools for participation to adapt them to a changing reality.

## How we work
We see participation as a process in which we can take action on specific steps, while being aware of the process as a whole. This model was developed by the EU D-CENT project.
