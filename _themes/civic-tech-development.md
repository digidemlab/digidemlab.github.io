We support associations and civil society with technological development and are a driving force in Civic Tech Sweden, part of the international network Code for All. As part of this work, we ran the Civic Tech Platform project in 2020-2022 with the support of Vinnova, which coordinated and supported Swedish civic tech initiatives.

In the international research project COLDIGIT, we have been investigating collective intelligence for three years together with actors such as the University of Helsinki, Nesta, SINTEF and GRI. The aim is to investigate how trust between citizens and public institutions can be increased through digital democracy tools, and how citizens can collaborate with each other to create solutions to complex societal challenges.

In 2018-2020, we developed digital citizen participation and introduced new platforms for participation for Swedish municipalities and neighbourhoods within the Vinnova-funded project Democratic Cities.

In 2017-2019, we ran an Heritage Fund-funded project to develop digital tools for
participation for young people, where we facilitated 40 innovative digital democracy projects.

Digidem Lab led international teams at Media Lab Matadero's Inteligencia Colectiva conference in 2016 and 2017 to create a guide for digital democracy tools and make the citizen participation platform Consul more accessible, in close collaboration with the City of Madrid.
