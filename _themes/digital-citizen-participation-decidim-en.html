<p>
<strong>Decidim is a digital platform for participation</strong> used worldwide by cities, associations, governments, and the European Commission.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Platform features can be combined</strong> to create a variety of participation types, such as participatory budgets, local assemblies, citizen proposals, and dialogue processes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The platform is open source</strong>, so improvements developed by larger cities like Barcelona and Helsinki are also available to smaller cities.
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Digidem Lab is the official partner</strong> for Decidim and develops and supports digital participation in combination with process design and facilitation.
</p>

<h3>Features that can be combined into participation processes</h3>

<blockquote><p>Decidim is a platform created to increase access to information and dialogue. Giving sovereignty over technology to citizens means making them co-creators and owners of public services, which for us is the definition of a Smart City.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Designed for inclusive participation</h2>

<h3>Principles for Decidim</h3>
<p>Those who use Decidim commit to a <a href="https://docs.decidim.org/en/v0.28/understand/social-contract.html">social contract</a>, which includes equal and inclusive participation and transparent processes.
Decidim uses open-source code, which means you don't pay licensing fees for using the code. It also means you benefit from the development and improvement of the platform by other cities.</p>

<h3>Personal Data</h3>
<p>We handle personal data according to GDPR and your guidelines and sign a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with you for the project. All our data handling is done on servers within the EU, and no data is shared with external third-party services.</p>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>
