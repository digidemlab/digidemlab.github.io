Digidem Lab offers courses in organising with a focus on local contexts, providing participants with methods and tools to strengthen their community. The course is both theoretical and practical and provides a foundation in navigating strategy, power, equity, listening and more. Participants have the opportunity to test methods directly and reflect on how they can be used in their own context.

The course is aimed at local organisers who are in some way working on local development, association activists, community leaders, facilitators and activists who recognise the need to build power from below and want to develop their own and others' capacity to self-organise to create the change they want to see.
