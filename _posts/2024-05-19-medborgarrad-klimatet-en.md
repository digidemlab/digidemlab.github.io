This Sunday marked the culmination of Sweden's pioneering National Climate Council. Participants from all walks of life — young and old, urban and rural — came together to tackle the urgent matter of climate change.

Through open dialogue and collaboration, these 58 randomly selected citizens have proposed ways for Sweden to reduce emissions and meet Paris Agreement targets. It's more than recommendations; it's about the enriching experience of engaging in democracy, discovering common ground, and fostering hope through diverse perspectives. This process has been conducted by Digidem Lab in collaboration with FAIRTRANS.

The Citizens' Council presents its climate proposals. [Read about the Counsil in media and follow the presentation via Zoom on May 20th at 10:00 AM here](https://fairtrans.nu/medborgarrad-om-klimatet/).
