This training course is tailored for those with experience and passion for community improvement. The course will provide new tools and sharpen your current ones with sharp lecturers.

* 30 YH credits
* Part-time for 12 weeks in Gothenburg
* Free of charge and CSN-eligible
* 1 October - 22 December 2023

During the training, you will gain knowledge of the Community Organising framework, its theories and conceptual systems. The training can be combined with work and you work with cases from your own organisation around the challenges of working member-driven, raising local leaders, mapping power, organizing sustainably and being strategically long-term.

The training is given by Digidem Lab and Nätverkstan in collaboration with international partners in Community Organising. The training is developed in collaboration with Save the Children, Folkets Hus och Parker, SAQMI (The Swedish Archive for Queer Moving Images), Amnesty, Page 28, the Church of Sweden, Föreningen Navet i Bergsjön and Frihamnsdagarna and is based on challenges they face in their daily work and the needs for collaboration and knowledge they see.

> We are incredibly proud to present this programme. For five years, we have been working to create a vocational training in organising. We believe that Sweden's civil society has a lot to gain from meeting, getting a terminology for different methods of change and having the time and space to take tactics and strategy further in the ecosystem of local associations and established organisations that strive in the same direction. We are creating a course we would have liked to take ourselves and are eager to share the content with those who will take the training.
