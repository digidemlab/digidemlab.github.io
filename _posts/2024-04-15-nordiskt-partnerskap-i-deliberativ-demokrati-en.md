Facts

> Our society is facing complex challenges and declining trust and participation in democracy. The purpose of Nordic Deliberation is to strengthen the implementation of deliberative democracy in the Nordic countries with the ambition to give citizens more influence over their own lives and environments. In collaboration with researchers, we will show how such processes can strengthen and complement our representative democracies.

says Zakia Elvang, Partner at We Do Democracy, one of the founding members of the partnership.

### Inspire the world
Through systematic collaboration on democratic innovation, Nordic welfare states can ensure robust democracies and serve as an inspiration to the rest of the world, according to Nordic Deliberation. The partnership was founded to facilitate these future collaborations and consists of the leading actors working with deliberative democracy in the Nordic countries: We Do Democracy in Denmark, Sitra in Finland, DigidemLab in Sweden, Analyse & Tal in Denmark and Norway, and SoCentral in Norway.

### Deliberative wave in Europe and the Nordics
Deliberative democracy is growing rapidly globally, and democratic innovation is increasingly becoming internationally oriented with collaborations and projects across borders. Over the past five years, the trend has also gained momentum in the Nordic region, where 53 citizens’ assemblies have been held since 2019.

With many similarities between the democratic systems and welfare models, there is much to be gained from closer cooperation between the Nordic actors. Nordic Deliberation will act as a hub for this collaboration and a gateway to the entire Nordic democracy sector.

> The partnership will contain a database of methods and facts about deliberative democracy in the Nordic countries, and it will be a competent consortium that can take on major international tasks within deliberative democracy.

### What is deliberative democracy and why do we need it?
Deliberation means that we arrive at something through talking together. In a representative democracy, a small group of elected politicians make decisions on behalf of the people. Deliberative democracy can expand and complement representative democracy by involving more people in decision-making – and doing so with time for discussion, reflection and mutual understanding.

Research shows that deliberative processes – such as citizens’ assemblies – can lead to better policy development, enable politicians to make difficult decisions and increase trust between citizens and authorities. It can also counteract polarization and show that it is indeed possible for citizens to change their minds after listening to others’ perspectives on the topic.
