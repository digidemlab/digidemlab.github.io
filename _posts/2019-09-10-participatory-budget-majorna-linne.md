### Assignment
Majorna-Linné did their second participatory budget in the fall of 2019. Everyone living in Majorna-Linné can make proposals and vote for projects, with a total budget of 450 000 SEK.

64 000
: Majorna-Linné is the largest district in Gothenburg with 64 000 inhabitants.

450 000
: The total budget of the participatory budget process was 450 000 SEK.

### Requirements
The city district wanted to digitalise their process and make it more transparent for citizens and got in touch with Digidem Lab. Based on their requirement for a plattform that is easy to use for civil servants and that facilitates increased internal communication, we chose to work with Consul.

## Solution
We installed and adapted the platform based on Majorna-Linnés needs and monitor the running of the budget process.

Before the start of the participatory budget, we did a two day training with every civil servant involved in the process.

> This is the first time Consul is being used in the Nordic countries.

## About the method
Participatory budgeting is a well established method that has been used in 1500 cities and institutions all over the world. It means that citizens get to decide about a specific part of the budget for their city, city district, country or organisation.
