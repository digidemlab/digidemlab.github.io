The project Ecosocial Neighborhoods: Tools for Sustainable Consumption and Inclusive Climate Transition is carried out in collaboration between the [Lund municipality,](https://lund.se/ "lund municipality en link") Digidem Lab, [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/ "LU climate dialogue"), and [Stockholm Environment Institute](https://www.sei.org/ "SEI climate dialogue"). A central part of the project is a climate dialogue led by Digidem Lab. Around 20 residents in Norra Fäladen will together develop measures that can reduce households’ consumption-based emissions without compromising the possibility of living a good life.

In mid-September, invitation will be sent out to approximately 2,000 residents, who will have the opportunity to sign up to participate in the dialogue. A representative sample of about 20 people will then be randomly selected and invited to take part. The aim is to create a dialogue where new knowledge, diverse experiences, and perspectives can meet and, together with Lund municipality, identify what is needed for residents of Norra Fäladen to reduce their climate emissions while still enjoying a good quality of life. Similar to a citizens’ assembly, the participants will jointly develop recommendations for the municipality’s politicians.

Digidem Lab is responsible for leading the recruitment of participants through a stratified selection process, facilitating the dialogue, and designing the format in close collaboration with the Lund municipality, Lund University, and Stockholm Environment Institute. With our methodological expertise in participatory processes and democratic innovations, together with our project partners’ subject-matter expertise, we'll create a space where residents can learn about climate issues and consumption-based emissions, and about who holds responsibility for which emissions. Residents will also have the opportunity to discuss, listen to each other, and generate ideas that can be brought forward in the municipality’s work.

Through the climate dialogue, Digidem Lab, together with Lund municipality, is developing a new approach based on the citizens’ assembly method that could serve as a model for how municipalities can involve residents in tackling complex societal challenges.
